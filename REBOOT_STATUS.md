# WASABI Reboot Status

## Completed âœ…

### 1. Architecture Design
- Created clean, modular architecture in `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Feature-based folder structure for better organization
- Clear separation of concerns to avoid the brittle architecture of previous versions

### 2. Project Setup
- Modern React 19 + TypeScript + Vite stack
- TailwindCSS for flexible styling
- Zustand for simple state management
- IndexedDB via Dexie for local data storage
- React Query for data fetching/caching
- Recharts for data visualization

### 3. Core UI Components
- **Layout**: Main app shell with sidebar and header
- **Sidebar**: Dark theme with navigation, matches design from screenshots
- **Header**: Search bar with theme toggle
- **Welcome Page**: Clean landing page with project overview
- **Routing**: Set up for all major sections

### 4. Design System
- Implemented requested aesthetic:
  - Rounded corners throughout
  - Glass/blur effects with `.glass-effect` class
  - Dark sidebar with light content areas
  - Green accent color (#10B981)
  - Light/dark mode toggle

## In Progress ðŸš§

### Data Import System Rebuild (December 2024)
- **Approach**: Complete rebuild with enrollment file as master index
- **Status**: Starting fresh implementation
- **Key Changes**:
  - Excel file support (.xls/.xlsx) instead of CSV
  - Three-tier matching: DCPS ID, FL ID, Name
  - Enrollment file as master index for all matching
  - Console debug view for upload process
  - Simplified UI with single upload button

## Next Steps ðŸ“‹

- [ ] FAST assessments adapter (using FL ID)
- [ ] STAR assessments adapter

### 3. Student Profile Components

- Profile card layout
- Data modules for each source
- Charts for performance trends

### 4. Analytics Features
- Class-level analytics
- Grade-level analytics
- Flagging system for at-risk students

## How to Run

```bash
cd wasabi
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

## Architecture Benefits

The new architecture addresses the issues from previous versions:

1. **Flexibility**: Easy to modify UI components without breaking functionality
2. **Maintainability**: Clear feature boundaries and minimal dependencies
3. **Performance**: Lazy loading and efficient state management
4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors
5. **Simplicity**: No over-engineering or unnecessary abstractions

The foundation is now solid and ready for implementing the core functionality!
