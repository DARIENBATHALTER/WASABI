NOTES
=====
- Science and Writing standards were in Excel format and not processed in this extraction
- Early Literacy (K-2) assessments use different domain-based scoring rather than specific standards
- Each standard can have multiple sub-components (indicated by additional decimal places)
- Student performance on each standard is measured as "Points Earned" vs "Points Possible"
